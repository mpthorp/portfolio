	<h3>pinkelstar</h3>
	<p>Now known as Zwapp, Pinkelstar enabled its users to easily discover and share popular apps amongst their friends. Users could see what apps their friends were using, downloading and also share their own favourite apps.</p>
	<p>My role was to design and develop the public facing website which facilitated an intro to the app, how to get it, blog discussions and information about the company behind it.</p>
